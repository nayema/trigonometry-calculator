# Trigonometry Calculator

This simple app was created to exemplify OOP and includes a Menu Helper class to create prompt options for the user.

The following steps are executed:

### Step 1: Select 2D or 3D
The user is asked to type the following:
1. "2D" - for 2D Triangle calculations
2. "3D" - for 3D Triangle calculations

## For 2D Triangle:
--------------------
### Step 2:
The user is given the following options:
1. Calculate distance of each side of the triangle
1. Calculate angles of each point of the triangle
1. Calculate area of triangle
1. Determine triangle type based on sides
1. Determine triangle type based on angles
1. All of the above

### Step 3: Enter x and y coordinates of each point on the triangle

### Step 4: Output generated based on user's option


## For 3D Triangle:
--------------------
### Step 2:
The user is given the following options:
1. Calculate distance of each side of the triangle
1. Calculate angles of each point of the triangle
1. Calculate area of triangle
1. Determine triangle type based on sides
1. Determine triangle type based on angles
1. All of the above

### Step 3: Enter x and y coordinates of each point on the triangle

### Step 4: Output generated based on user's option
